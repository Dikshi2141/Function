        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, both iterators and iterables are important concepts related to iteration, but they serve different roles. Here’s a breakdown of the differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterable\n",
        "An iterable is any object in Python that can be looped over (iterated) using a for loop or other iteration mechanisms. An iterable is an object that implements the __iter__() method, which returns an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common examples of iterables include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists\n",
        "Tuples\n",
        "Strings\n",
        "Dictionaries (iterating over keys or values)\n",
        "Sets\n",
        "The key feature of an iterable is that it can be converted into an iterator using the iter() function. Once an object is an iterable, Python can use it to produce an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterator\n",
        "An iterator is an object that keeps track of its current position during iteration. It must implement two methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "__iter__() — Returns the iterator object itself (this allows the iterator to be used in a loop).\n",
        "__next__() — Returns the next item from the collection, or raises StopIteration when the iteration is complete.\n",
        "An iterator allows you to traverse through the items of an iterable one by one, but it does not store all the items in memory at once (making it more memory efficient in some cases, especially with large data structures)."

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "n Python, generators are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples, but with a key difference: they generate items one at a time as needed (on-demand), rather than storing all items in memory at once. This makes them more memory-efficient, especially when working with large datasets or streams of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Generators Work:\n",
        "Generators use the yield keyword to produce values one by one. Each time a generator's __next__() method is called (either directly or via a loop), it resumes from where it left off, maintaining its state between calls. When a yield statement is executed, it pauses the generator function, \"yields\" a value to the caller, and keeps track of the execution state, so that it can continue from that point when the next value is requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "Defining a Generator:\n",
        "A generator is typically defined using a function with the yield keyword. Here's an example:\n",

        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",

        "        yield count  # Yield returns a value and pauses the function\n",
        "        count += 1\n",
        "Using the Generator:\n",
        "Once the generator function is defined, you can create a generator object and iterate over it to get the yielded values:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",

        "5\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Generators only compute the next value when needed (lazily). This is efficient when dealing with large or infinite sequences.\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: Unlike lists, which store all items in memory, generators produce items on the fly, making them much more memory-efficient for large datasets.\n",
        "Stateful: A generator function retains its state between calls (i.e., variables and the point in the function where it last yielded a value).\n",
        "Generator Expressions:\n",
        "In addition to defining a generator function, you can also use generator expressions, which are similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses instead of square brackets:\n",
